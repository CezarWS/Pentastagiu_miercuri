What is the relationship between the following: error, bug, defect, fault, failure.


ERROR: An error is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer. In the category of developer we include software engineers, programmers, analysts, and testers. For example, a developer may misunderstand a de-sign notation, or a programmer might type a variable name incorrectly â€“ leads to an Error. It is the one which is generated because of wrong login, loop or due to syntax. Error normally arises in software; it leads to change the functionality of the program.
BUG: A bug is the result of a coding error. An Error found in the development environment before the product is shipped to the customer. A programming error that causes a program to work poorly, produce incorrect results or crash. An error in software or hardware that causes a program to malfunction. Bug is terminology of Tester.
FAULT: An incorrect step, process or data definition in a computer program which causes the program to perform in an unintended or unanticipated manner. A fault is introduced into the software as the result of an error. 
FAILURE: A failure is the inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements. When a defect reaches the end customer it is called a Failure. During development Failures are usually observed by testers.
